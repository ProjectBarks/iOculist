A mobile application that tracks the distance between the user's eyes as he backs away from his phone. It uses Snellen's formulas and voice recognition to generate a highly accurate eye exam on your iOS or Android device. This test checks for visual acuity, color blindness, and astigmatism. This app has won **2<sup>nd</sup> Place** at [HackBCA](https://devpost.com/software/ioculist)!

### Why and How...

After talking to numerous optometrist it became evident that a lot of the tests done to identify eyesight issues can be done at home as long as it is facilitated by someone qualified. We decided that phones possess the technology to properly run those tests and could provide medical attention to those who can not afford such a luxury.
